## WordPress Code Snippets for Sublime Text

This is a compilation of WordPress code snippets for Sublime Text. Sources include my own work as well as modifications of snippets from: 

* [purplefish32 - sublime-text-2-wordpress](https://github.com/purplefish32/sublime-text-2-wordpress)
* [jghazally - WordPress-Devs](https://github.com/jghazally/WordPress-Dev)

## Installation

I haven't bother to upload to the Sublime Package Control Channel. Manual installation is dead simple anyway. Simply:

1. Clone or download this repository
2. In Sublime Text 3 Preferences -> Browse Packages
3. Drop the cloned/downloaded folder in Packages/User
